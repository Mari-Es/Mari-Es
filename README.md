# 👋 Hi, I'm Marzieh

## 🌱 About Me
I'm a data-driven problem solver and aspiring AI/ML engineer, currently completing my Master's degree at UBC, where I’m developing my thesis while continuously expanding my technical toolkit. Before coming to Canada, I worked as a Senior Data Analyst and Business Intelligence Analyst in Iran, delivering actionable insights and decision-support tools across multiple industries.

I’m most energized when working at the intersection of data science, machine learning, and real-world impact — whether it's training a large language model, building smart data pipelines, or deploying scalable solutions on the cloud.

I’m currently sharpening my skills in LLMs, MLOps, and cloud tools like Azure, AWS, and Databricks, while contributing to open-source projects and building my portfolio through real-world applications in NLP, recommendation systems, and ML pipelines.

When I’m not immersed in data or modeling workflows, you might find me exploring nature, solving puzzles, watching sci-fi movies, or diving into podcasts about AI and innovation.
